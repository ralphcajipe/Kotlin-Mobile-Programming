/**
 *  Function Problem: Fibonacci Sequence
 *  The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where
 *  a number is the addition of the last two numbers, starting with 0, and 1.
 *  The Fibonacci Sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55â€¦
 *
 *  Written as a rule, the expression is:
 *  Xn = Xn-1 + Xn-2
 *
 *  Complete the given program code that will compute
 *  the sum of the terms of the Fibonacci sequence.
